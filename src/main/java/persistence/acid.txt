Why Transactions Matters:
    - Let’s set the scene. You're transferring €100 from Alice to Bob.
      Two things need to happen: debit Alice’s account and credit Bob’s.
      What if your app crashes halfway through? Now Alice is €100 poorer, and Bob is still broke.
      That’s not a bug, it’s a lawsuit waiting to happen.

This is why we need ACID-compliant transactions:
    - Atomicity: all or nothing
    - Consistency: keep the database valid
    - Isolation: no cross-talk between concurrent operations
    - Durability: changes that stick, even after a power outage
