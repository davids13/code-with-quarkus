forged token:
    -  the JWT. It’s short for JSON Web Token—a three-part digital passport,
       often passed around in HTTP headers like a VIP backstage pass
    - Forgery happens when this signature is faked or if an API doesn’t verify it properly

jwt structure:
    - x.y.z
    x - header: algorithm and type (e.g., rs256, jwt)
    y - payload: claims about the entity (like sub, upn, groups, etc)
    z - signature: the proof. signed with private key; verified with public one

cryptographic lock:
    - one key locks (private key)
    - another opens (public key)
    - this ensures that only the token issuer can sign, but anyone can verify
